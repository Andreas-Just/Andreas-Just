### Hobbies and Interests

#### Photography and Design

> Since my university days, I have been passionate about design and photography. Two years after graduation, I began my career as a designer in the advertising industry. However, four years into this role, my curiosity shifted towards web development. As I delved deeper into this field, I realized that not only did I enjoy it, but I also had a natural aptitude for it. This led me to pursue web development as my profession. Nonetheless, my love for visual arts and photography has remained with me. I still enjoy conducting photo sessions and creating engaging videos for my friends and family, blending my artistic flair with my technical skills.

#### Read the Bible

> My fascination with the Bible goes beyond mere reading; it's a journey of discovery and enlightenment. Each page offers new insights and wisdom, profoundly impacting my perspective on life. It's not just a book for me, but a source of deep spiritual nourishment and inner peace. The stories, teachings, and parables provide guidance and solace, making it a cherished part of my daily routine. This sacred text continues to be a beacon, illuminating my path with its timeless truths and providing a grounding presence in the ever-changing tapestry of life.
